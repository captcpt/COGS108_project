## Final Project for COGS108: Data Science in Practice

This is a project conducted for COGS108 at UCSD, SP23.

### Overview:
The BRFSS or Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System is a nationwide telephone survey conducted by the CDC every year to gather various health data ranging from exercise to diet to healthcare access. They provide basic data visualization tools to observe some variables such as alcohol consumption across the general nation or for specific states/regions, however it does not effectively demonstrate general health trends and/or comparisons between regions. Thus, there is no definitive evidence for the relevance, benefit, and/or usability of the general BRFSS survey and data. Other organizations (outside of the CDC) have created health indeces to rank general health of states, but they often use alternative data sources and/or independent weighting of variables to do this. Thus, the purpose of this analysis is to see the general trends/output of BRFSS data in particular and see if it is a good method of data collection and representation of US general health.
